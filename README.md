### Problem Statement

Dengue is one of the top endemic diseases in Singapore and it has reached new highs in incidence and death rates in recent years [[1]](#1) [[2]](#2). With Singapore having a generally wet and hot climate, and rainfall being one of the main drivers of dengue transmission [[3]](#3) [[4]](#4), this project aims to provide an exploratory analysis on rainfall data and number of dengue cases to improve resource allocation and preventive measures, hence reducing public resource overload.

### Summary of Analysis

The yearly, monthly and cluster trends of number of rainy days and dengue data were done. 

The monthly trends of number of rainy days and dengue cases are rather consistent over the years respectively. By comparing the two, dengue data shows a 2-months lagged period of the dengue cases from the number of rainy days.

There is no apparent correlation between the yearly trends - the peaks in dengue cases finds a corresponding peak in number of rainy days data, but this was not the case anymore for the past 10 years. This could be attributed to the Covid-19 situation, where it induced a spike in dengue cases initially due to more people staying at home and hence being exposed to breeding grounds [[5]](#5), and a further surge in Covid-19 cases resulted in lack of detection and reporting of dengue cases attributing to the reduced access to health facilities. There could be a hesitancy to seek medical care at facilities due to concern of possible exposure to COVID-19 patients as well [[6]](#6).

A cluster analysis at 3 regions showed an effectiveness of Project Wolbachia on dengue prevention since the peak in cases at targeted areas (Tampines, Yishun) had not worsened over the years, as compared to the non-targeted region (Geylang). However, further work has to be done to anlayse the impact of number of rainy days on dengue cases at different regions.

### Conclusion

Here are some recommndations based on the exploratory analysis:
- Optimise resource allocation, prevention strategy and medical resources using monthly rainfall data or forecast
     - Make use of the lead time of 2 months to allocate medical resources after long days of rainfall in a month. 
     - For yearly forecast, take into consideration humidity and temperature data as well.
- Data-sharing
    - Historical dengue cases data were not provided anymore after 2019, and it was not easy to obtain cluster data well. These could be made avilable to leverage on crowd efforts to generate better analysis and prediction of dengue cases.
- Accelerate Project Wolbachia to areas with greater variations in rainfall days.
    - The west side tend to be the wetter region. Upon further analysis, Project Wolbachia may potentially be prioritised for those districts. [[7]](#7)
