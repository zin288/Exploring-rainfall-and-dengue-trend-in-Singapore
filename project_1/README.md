### Problem Statement

Dengue fever has been a significant public health concern in Singapore, impacting the population's health and well-being. The country has experienced periodic outbreaks of dengue fever, with varying intensities and geographical spread. The disease is transmitted by the Aedes mosquito and can lead to severe symptoms, hospitalizations, and, in some cases, fatalities. Analyzing the trends of dengue fever cases is of utmost importance as it provides valuable insights into the patterns and dynamics of the disease. Understanding the factors that contribute to the spread of dengue, including rainfall patterns, enables health authorities to implement targeted prevention and control measures. By analyzing the trends, authorities can better allocate resources, enhance mosquito control efforts, and educate the public about effective preventive measures. This analysis plays a crucial role in mitigating the impact of dengue fever on the Singapore population and improving overall public health outcomes.

### Datasets

#### Provided Data

There are 2 datasets included in the [`data`](./data/) folder for this project. These correponds to rainfall information. 

* [`rainfall-monthly-number-of-rain-days.csv`](./data/rainfall-monthly-number-of-rain-days.csv): Monthly number of rain days from 1982 to 2022. A day is considered to have “rained” if the total rainfall for that day is 0.2mm or more.
* [`rainfall-monthly-total.csv`](./data/rainfall-monthly-total.csv): Monthly total rain recorded in mm(millimeters) from 1982 to 2022

Other relevant weather datasets from [data.gov.sg](data.gov.sg) that you can download and use are as follows:

* [Relative Humidity](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/relative-humidity-monthly-mean)
* [Monthly Maximum Daily Rainfall](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/rainfall-monthly-maximum-daily-total)
* [Hourly wet bulb temperature](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/wet-bulb-temperature-hourly)
* [Monthly mean sunshine hours](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/sunshine-duration-monthly-mean-daily-duration)
* [Surface Air Temperature](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/surface-air-temperature-mean-daily-minimum)

#### Additional Data
* `dengue and others.xlsx`: Yearly number of notiable diseases from 1966 to 2021. Dengue/DHF was made a notifiable disease from August 1977. However it was administratively notifiable within government institutions since October 1966. [Source: https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M870081]
* [`weekly-number-of-dengue-cases.csv`](../data/weekly-number-of-dengue-cases/weekly-number-of-dengue-and-dengue-haemorrhagic-fever-cases.csv.csv): Weekly number of lab-confirmed dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever cases from 2014 to 2018
